# signatureViewer
Webpage and server to view cuckoo descriptions by searching their descriptions

Backend config lets you specify location of signatures and port to host api on

Frontend config lets you specify API URL

Future Work:
  - Swap to use production server instead of webpack dev server
  - Swap backend over to use yarn and babel to allow us to use es6 imports
